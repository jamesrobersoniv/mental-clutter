IS AN OFFERING OF SORTS.


OUT OF SEASON. OUT OF STEP.


IN ALL HONESTY, NOT IN JEST,


I PROMISE YOU THE SUN HAS


NOT SET ON MY CHERRY RED.



WHY THEN CARRY THAT CHERRY RED 


THAT BRINGS ONLY STORIES 


OF BUBBLES ON BEACHES?


OF BLADES OF GREEN DANCING?


OF THONGS AND HALF-EATEN PLUMS?


ALWAYS SOME NIGHT IN MID-OCTOBER.



BECAUSE ONCE, AN ANGEL GREETED ME


CHERRY RED LIPS AND ALL


PLEATED IN STEEL ONE NIGHT IN MID-OCTOBER.


I LEANED IN CLOSE AND SHE WHISPERED


AMARETTO ON HER BREATH


“I HOPE I FORGET, OF YOU,


THE CHIP ON MY SHOULDER.”



SWEETNESS, UNTASTED,


LEFT A CRAVING.
